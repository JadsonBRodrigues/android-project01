        <h1>The History of the Android Mascot</h1>

        <p>You are probably aware that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, developed and maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used platforms for mobile devices worldwide. However, did you know that its cheerful mascot has a name and a fascinating backstory? Follow this article to learn all about this adorable little robot.
        
        <h2>The First Version</h2>
        
        <p>The first attempt to create a mascot was made in 2007 by a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He recalls opening <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="externo">Inkscape</a> (a free and open-source image vectorisation software) and designing his own version of a robot. The goal was simply to give the system a persona for his team; there was no official request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

        <p>This weird first version was even named in honour of its creator: they were called the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>A new mascot is born</h2>
        
        <p>The idea of having a mascot began to mature, and the mission was assigned to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" class="externo">Irina Blok</a>, who was also a Google employee, was tasked with representing the small robot in a more appealing way.</p>

        </picture>
        
        <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few lines and in a more flat design. The drawing also needed to quickly establish identification with the viewer. This led to the creation of the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new Android mascot.</p>
        
        <img src="arquivos-site/imagens/bugdroid.png"class=pequena alt="Bugdroid">
        
        <p>The main inspiration for the new <strong>Bugdroid's</strong> design came from the small figures used on restroom doors to indicate gender. Legend has it that the artist was working at her desk at the <strong>Google</strong> office when she glanced at the bathroom signs, and the idea hit her instantly: simple, clean, and direct.</p>

            <p>Another curious aspect of Android is that each version was named after a dessert, following alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 - <abbr title="Bolo de Copo">Cupcake</abbr></li>
                <li>1.6 - <abbr title="Rosquinha">Donut</abbr></li>
                <li>3.0 - <abbr title="Bomba">Eclair</abbr></li>
                <li>2.2 - <abbr title="Iogurte Congelado">Froyo</abbr></li>
                <li>2.3 - <abbr title="Biscoito de Gengibre">Gingerbread</abbr></li>
                <li>3.0 - <abbr title="Favo de Mel">Honeycomb</abbr></li>
                <li>4.0 - <abbr title="SanduÃ­che de Sorvete">Ice Cream Sandwich</abbr></li>
                <li>4.1 - <abbr title="Jujuba">Jelly Bean</abbr></li>
                <li>4.4 - <abbr title="KitKat">KitKat</abbr></li>
                <li>5.0 - <abbr title="Pirulito">Lolipop</abbr></li>
                <li>6.0 - <abbr title="Marshmallow">Marshmallow</abbr></li>
                <li>7.0 - <abbr title="Torone">Nougat</abbr></li>
                <li>8.0 - <abbr title="Oreo">Oreo</abbr></li>
                <li>9.0 - <abbr title="Torta">Pie</abbr></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, Android Q never came to be, as Google decided to end the tradition of naming each version after a dessert. Instead, they switched to numerical naming, which led to Android 10. </p>
